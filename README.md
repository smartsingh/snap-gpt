# Excelsior! Welcome to Snap-GPT, True Believers!

Greetings, web-slingers and mighty Marvel enthusiasts! Get ready to embark on an adventure like no other, as we dive into the wondrous world of Snap-GPT. This repository is not just a code collection; it's a cosmic convergence of LangChain, Pandas, and Gradio, all coming together to explore the dynamic integration of Marvel SNAP data with the heart and soul of the internet - ChatGPT!

## Project Components - Nuff Said!

### 1. Data

Behold the treasure trove in the `data` folder! We've got datasets from Kaggle.com and wisdom from IGN.com. This is where the magic begins, as we weave tales with Marvel SNAP data and bring it to life through the incredible power of technology.

### 2. Jupyter Notebooks

Face front, True Believers! Feast your eyes upon two mighty Jupyter notebooks:

- **Snap-GPT Notebook:** Watch as a Vector Store and a Chain join forces to pass data to ChatGPT. It's like watching Thor swing Mjolnirâ€”majestic and powerful!

- **csv_test Notebook:** LangChain's `create_pandas_dataframe_agent` takes center stage, evolving the data integration process with the mysterious sophistication of the High Evolutionary. Learn how to pass data to ChatGPT with a touch of cosmic wisdom!

## Technologies Used - Assemble!

- **LangChain:** The secret sauce that makes everything tick! LangChain, like Doctor Strange's spells, streamlines data integration and ensures a seamless experience.

- **ChatGPT:** This is our very own secret agent, weaving conversations with the finesse and precision of Natasha Romanoff. Unleash the power of interactive dialogue!

- **Pandas:** As reliable as Captain America's shield, Pandas stands strong, manipulating data and preparing it for an epic team-up with ChatGPT.

- **Gradio:** Witness the UI wizardry! Gradio is our very own Tony Stark, creating a UI that even J.A.R.V.I.S. would be proud of, allowing you to interact with ChatGPT in style.

## Getting Started - Avengers, Assemble!

1. Clone this repository to your lair.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/snap-gpt.git
```

2. Swing over to the project directory.

```bash
cd snap-gpt
```

3.Dive into the Jupyter notebooks (snap-gpt.ipynb and csv_test.ipynb) like Wolverine slashing through enemies. Learn the different methods to integrate Marvel SNAP data with ChatGPT.

4.Tinker with the datasets in the data folder. It's like having the Infinity Stones at your fingertips.

5.Run the notebooks and unleash the power of one greater than Onslaught - Snap-GPT!

Happy coding, True Believers! ðŸš€âœ¨
